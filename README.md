# EUSIPCO-2025-CARMA

This provides an implementation of the algorithm proposed in our paper:
> R.J McDougall and S.J. Godsill, "On the Construction of Discrete-Time ARMA Models from Continuous-Time State-Space Models".

This will be presented at the [European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)](https://eusipco2025.org/) in Palermo, Italy in September 2025.

If you would like to use or copy any of the code provided here, please cite the original paper.

## Project structure

The results from our paper can be reproduced by running `scripts/run_experiments.jl`.
All model conversion code is available in the `ModelConversions` package within `src/`.
